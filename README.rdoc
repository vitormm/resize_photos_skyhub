This is the Resize photos â€“ SkyHub challenge from Vitor Matta

This application was created to:
* Consume a webservice endpoint (http://54.152.221.29/images.json) that returns a JSON of photos. There are 10 photos.
* Generate three different formats for each photo. The dimensions are: small (320x240), medium (384x288) and large (640x480).
* Expose a webservice endpoint that lists (in JSON format) all the ten photos with their respective formats, providing their URLs.
* Show every image with its many ormats (it was a plus)

This project was created using ruby on rails due to the facilities and libraries to deal with images to resize with no pain.
It uses:
* mongodb and paperclip gem to deal with images.
* Rspec and factory girl to make the tests.
* Rest-client to deal with http requests
* Sucker punch to act as asynchronous processing library. I choose sucker punch because it is easy to integrate and does not require many configurations when deployed.
* To interact with mongodb, mongoid was used.
* To convert the images, ImageMagick must be installed on your system.

* System dependencies
  * mongodb (v2.6.12 was used in a fedora 24 box). Ensure mongodb is installed and running on your system
  * ImageMagick is very inportant to use mongoid-paperclip and must be installed on your system before proceed. Ensure ImageMagick is installed on your system and that '''convert''' command is available after the installation


* Configuration
 * Run '''bundle install''' to install the gems
 * Run '''rspec''' to performa the tests

* Deployment instructions
